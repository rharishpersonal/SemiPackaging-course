1. Basics of Semiconductor Packaging
Semiconductor packaging turns a fragile silicon die into a robust component that can be handled, assembled, powered, and cooled in real-world systems. Packaging provides protection, electrical input/output (I/O), mechanical stability, and thermal pathways.
  1.1	What is Packaging and Why It Matters
     •	After a silicon wafer is fabricated which is basically called as die, it contains thousands of tiny circuits (transistors)
     •	These dies are extremely weak and cannot be used directly in a system
     •	Packaging is the process of enclosing these dies in a protective structure that:
       o	Provides mechanical protection
      o	Enables electrical connectivity to the outside world like PCB
      o	Helps in heat dissipation
A silicon die fresh from the fab has microscopic pads for power and signals, no mechanical protection, and no native heat spreading capability. A package adds a substrate (carrier), external terminals (pins/balls/lands), an encapsulant (mold or lid), and thermal structures (heat spreaders, thermal vias, TIMs) to enable system integration.
1.2 Core Functions
•	Protection: provides protection against mechanical shock, moisture contamination, corrosion, and ESD (electro-static discharge)
•	Electrical Connectivity: provides pins, balls, or pads to connect power and high-speed signals from die to PCB
•	Mechanical Support and Reliability: Provides structural integrity to the assembly to minimize mechanical stress and potential damage during thermal cycling, such as solder reflow processes.
•	Thermal Management: Conducts and spreads heat away from active junctions to the ambient
1.3 Basic concept of a Package
•	Die: The silicon chip
•	Substrate: A base layer that routes signals and power
•	Interconnects: Wire bonds or solder bumps
•	Encapsulation: Mold compound for protection
•	External Terminals: Pins, balls, or leads for PCB connection
3. Semiconductor Industry Ecosystem
•	Fabless: Design chips (e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm)
•	Foundries: Fabricate wafers (e.g., TSMC, Samsung Foundry)
•	OSATs: Assembly and test specialists (e.g., ASE, Amkor)
•	IDMs: Vertically integrated, do everything (e.g., Intel, Micron).
4. Package Selection Criteria
•	Application: Logic, memory, analog/mixed-signal, RF, power
•	Electrical: I/O count, bandwidth/speed targets, signal integrity (loss, crosstalk), power delivery network PDN (IR drop, inductance, both these need to be low)
•	Thermal: Power density, junction-to-ambient targets, allowable temperature rise, Heat spreaders
•	Mechanical/Physical: Footprint, height, board-level constraints, reliability requirements
•	Cost & Supply: Package/substrate cost, assembly yield, material availability
•	Reliability: Moisture sensitivity, thermal cycling capability/stress, reflow.
5. Package Families and Mounting Styles
4.1	 Through-Hole and Surface-Mount Packages
•	Through-Hole (TH): DIP, SIP, PGA — robust leads but lower I/O density
•	Surface-Mount (SMT): SOIC, TQFP, QFN — compact footprints; QFN offers exposed thermal pads
4.2 Array and Advanced Packages
•	BGA/LGA/FCBGA: Ball or land grid arrays on organic substrates, suitable for high-I/O SoCs
•	CSP: Chip-scale packages approach die size; common in mobile chips
•	PoP: package -on-package, vertically stacked logic + memory with short interconnects, all new SoC with LP5 memory have this kind of package
•	SiP: Multi-die + passives in one module for space-constrained systems. This is going to be common for AI SoC going forward to meet the system performance requirements
6. Interconnect Technologies
5.1 Wire Bond
•	Uses gold (Au)/copper (Cu)/Aluminum (Al) wires to connect die pads to lead frame/substrate pads.
•	Advantages: maturity, cost, flexibility
•	Considerations: loop inductance, SI limits at very high data rates, bond reliability.
5.2 Flip-Chip
•	Die is flipped and joined to the substrate via solder bumps (e.g., SnAgCu) to minimize loop inductance
•	Benefits: low inductance, high I/O density, short signal paths. Requires underfill for mechanical reinforcement.
5.3 Hybrid Bonding (Cu–Cu + Dielectric)
•	Cu-Cu direct bonding + dielectric bonding, this enables die-to-die link and increases bandwidth density
•	Enables <10 µm pitch for chiplets and 3D stacks.
5.4 Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)
•	Diameter: 5–10 µm, depth: 50–100 µm. Vertical vias for 3D stacks, enable direct interconnection between different layers
•	Liner: etched and filled with Cu for conductivity.
•	Advantages: reduces signal delay, power consumption, and form factor
7. Substrate and Interposer Technologies
6.1 Redistribution Layers (RDL)
Redistribution Layers are thin metal interconnect layers fabricated on the surface of a semiconductor die to reroute or “redistribute” the original input/output (I/O) pads to new locations. This process enables finer pitch connections and allows the die to interface with advanced packaging technologies such as flip-chip, wafer-level chip scale packaging (WLCSP), and fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP). RDLs typically consist of multiple layers of patterned metal and dielectric materials, providing flexible routing for electrical signals, power, and ground connections.
6.2 Silicon and Glass Interposers
An interposer is a substrate that serves as an intermediate layer between a semiconductor die (or multiple dies) and the package substrate or printed circuit board (PCB). Its primary function is to facilitate high-density electrical connections, signal routing, and sometimes power delivery between the dies and the underlying substrate.
•	Silicon Interposers:
o	fabricated using semiconductor manufacturing processes and often incorporate Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) for vertical electrical connections.
o	Offers Ultra-fine routing with TSVs for 2.5D integration (e.g., HBM + logic)
o	provide excellent thermal and mechanical properties but tend to be more expensive
•	Glass Interposers:
o	use glass substrates instead of silicon
o	excellent dimensional stability, lower cost, excellent electrical insulation
o	limitations in thermal conductivity compared to silicon and require specialized processes
•	Organic Interposers:
o	made from organic materials, such as epoxy resins reinforced with glass fibers, fabricated using standard PCB processes
o	cost-effective and scalable for high-volume production
o	Lower thermal conductivity and dimensional stability than glass/silicon
8. Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP)
WLP is an advanced semiconductor packaging technology in which the packaging process is performed at the wafer level, before the wafer is diced into individual chips (dies). Unlike traditional packaging, where each die is packaged separately after dicing, WLP enables the creation of fully packaged, tested, and ready-to-mount devices directly on the wafer.
•	Fan-In WLP: Pads redistributed within die area
•	Fan-Out WLP: Pads extended beyond die area for higher I/O
•	Advantages:
o	Smaller size, lower cost
o	Popular in smartphones and IoT

o	Monitors process control, detects defects early, and ensures yield
•	Parametric Testing:

o	Ensures process consistency and device reliability
9.2 OSAT Testing Stages

•	Pre-Assembly Testing:
o	Optional electrical or visual inspection of wafers/dies before assembly to confirm integrity
